## **React MadLibs Instructions**

Make a Madlibs game in React!

Here’s how it should function (feel free to change up the specific parts of speech and story):

As you can see, you’ll need a form for your Madlib, which, once submitted, shows the story with the form entries inserted. **Note that the GIF also includes the bonus features described below.**

You should have a top-level ***Madlib*** component, but beyond that the component hierarchy is up to you. Diagram out the hierarchy for yourself before you write any code! Please do not use a single React component.

**Document your code appropriately.**

### Video Notes:

four input fields:
- noun
- noun 2
- adjective
- color

one button: "Get Story"

### **Bonus**

- Improve the code so you can’t submit the form of prompts unless each one is filled out.
- Add a “Restart” button to the story, which restarts and goes back to the form prompting for answers.

### **Super Bonus**

- Allow the user to select between several story options before filling out their Madlib form.
